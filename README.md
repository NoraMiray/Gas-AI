# Gas-AI
A mathematical formula that can predict and evaluate new data by receiving relevant data


This project is one of my business plans that we want to launch in Iran with the help of my brother
In this project, we need meteorological data and data on subscribers' consumption and their house area
Finally, using data warehousing and mathematical formulas, we can examine and predict new data

## What can this formula do?
This formula considers the following:
  a. How much energy is wasted in the house?
  b. What is the temperature of the house?
  c. What is the comfort temperature of the house?
  d. What are the barriers and possibilities for gas consumption in the place?
  e. What barriers and facilities have existed for gas consumption in the past?
  f. How many people are in the house?
All these views can be found using only three data: temperature, area and consumption
